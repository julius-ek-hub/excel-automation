Worksheet target.
----------------------------

Whenever you create an excel file, it defaults to one worksheet called Sheet1.
You can check the name at the bottom left of the Excel file window.

Leave the answer to the target worksheet question as None if any of the following is true:
1) There is only one worksheet in the file, doesn't matter the name.
2) You are sure that the active worksheet is the worksheet the program needs to use. Active worksheet is the 
one that opens automatically when you launch an Excel file, it is usually the last worksheet you 
visited before closing and saving the file.
Otherwise you must provide the name of the worksheet as answer.
