Sheet target.
----------------------------

Whenever you create an excel file, it defaults to one sheet called Sheet1.
You can check the name at the bottom left of the Excel file window.

Leave the answer to the target sheet question as None if any of the following is true:
1) There is only one sheet in the file, doesn't matter the name.
2) You are sure that the active sheet is the sheet the program needs to use. Active sheet is the 
sheet that opens automatically when you launch an Excel file, it is usually the last sheet you 
visited before closing and saving the file.
Otherwise you must provide the name of the sheet as answer.
